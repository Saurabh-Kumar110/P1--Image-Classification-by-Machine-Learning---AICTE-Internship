##Image Classification Web Application

##Built with: Streamlit and TensorFlow
This cutting-edge web application is designed for image classification, leveraging two powerful machine learning models: MobileNetV2 (trained on ImageNet) and a custom CIFAR-10 model. Users can upload images and obtain predictions, including confidence scores, from either model.

##Key Features
#Dual Model Functionality:
MobileNetV2 (ImageNet): Capable of classifying images into 1,000 different categories from the ImageNet dataset, encompassing everyday objects, animals, and vehicles.
Custom CIFAR-10 Model: Tailored to classify images into ten specific categories, including airplanes, cars, birds, and cats.

#User-Friendly Design:
Sidebar Navigation: Seamlessly switch between the MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using an intuitive sidebar menu.
Instant Predictions: Upload an image and receive immediate predictions with confidence scores.

#Educational and Practical Uses:
Ideal for gaining insights into the performance of deep learning models.
Valuable for real-world applications where image classification is essential.

#Batch Processing:
Allows users to upload multiple images simultaneously for bulk classification.

#Top 3 Predictions Display:
Shows the top 3 predicted categories with confidence scores, offering a detailed output.

#CSV Export:
Users can download their prediction results in a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.

#Mobile-Friendly:
Fully responsive design ensures smooth operation on both desktop and mobile devices.

#Automatic Image Preprocessing:
Automatically resizes and preprocesses images to ensure compatibility with the models before making predictions.
